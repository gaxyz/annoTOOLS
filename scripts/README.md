# Scripts

This document contains the main outline of the scripts ran to perform the analysis


0. standardize\_gff3\_fasciolidae.py modifies the  gff3 file of FGIG and FBUS to make them suitable for analysis

1. rename\_table.py build a crossreference table for all relevant species and creates pickled gene dicitonaries (hierarchical data structure)

2. longest\_cds\_proteomes.py creates proteom files (.faa) with only longest CDS per gene for orthology analysis.
